Never odd or even
A used pink bathrobe
If I had a hi-fi
Madam, I'm Adam
No lemons, no melon
A rare mint snow globe
Lisa Bonet ate no basil
Was it a car or a cat I saw?
A Smurf TV tray
A man, a plan, a canal: Panama!
I bought on eBay
Rats live on no evil star
Ma is a selfless as I am
May a moody baby doom a yam?
"A Toyota's a Toyota"
Oh, no! Don Ho!
UFO tofu
